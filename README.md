# Discount-Pop-up
#### By Ian Knepper
## Logic to that triggers a pop-up to inform users of deals &amp; coupons

Purpose: Using the website marmot.com, JavaScript and jQuery code that can be run in the console of the browser on any product page.<br>

## The code does following:<br>

* Created a trigger that activates an overlay when the user clicks any size option.
* The overlay is centered on top of the site and displays the information gathered above along with two buttons - one button closes the overlay and the other should take the user to the cart page. The overlay reads: <br>
"Get this {product name} for {discounted price} with a 15% discount"

* Behind the overlay is a semiÂ­-transparent black background that obscures the site.
* The overlay is enabled to trigger multiple times if dismissed.
